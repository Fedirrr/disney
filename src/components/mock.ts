        companyDescription:"Disneyland is a theme park located at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. It holds the distinction of being the first theme park opened by The Walt Disney Company and is the only one designed and constructed under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. The park officially opened its doors on July 17, 1955. Originally, Disney envisioned creating a tourist attraction near his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit. However, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small for his ambitious ideas. After conducting a feasibility study with the Stanford Research Institute to determine a suitable location, Disney acquired a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. The park's design was entrusted to a creative team handpicked by Walt Disney from both internal and external talent. This team went on to establish WED Enterprises, the precursor to today's Walt Disney Imagineering. Construction commenced in 1954, and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955. Since its inauguration, Disneyland has undergone numerous expansions and significant renovations. Notable additions include New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019. In 2001, Disney California Adventure Park opened on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot. Disneyland boasts the highest cumulative attendance of any theme park globally, with 757 million visits since its opening (as of December 2021). In 2022, the park recorded approximately 16.9 million visits, ranking as the second most visited amusement park worldwide for that year, surpassed only by Magic Kingdom—the park it inspired. According to a 2005 Disney report, the Disneyland Resort supports 65,700 jobs, including around 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (independent contractors or their employees). In 2019, Disney announced \"Project Stardust,\" a initiative featuring significant structural renovations to accommodate increased attendance numbers.",

        companyDescription:"Star Wars is an American epic space opera media franchise created by George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film[a] and quickly became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.[b] Star Wars is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. The original 1977 film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope, was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to write and direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). All nine films, collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\", were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action \"anthology\" films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion, making Star Wars the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.",

        companyDescription:"National Geographic (formerly The National Geographic Magazine, sometimes branded as NAT GEO) is an American monthly magazine published by National Geographic Partners. Established in 1888 as a scholarly journal, the magazine shifted to become a popular publication, incorporating pictures from 1905 onwards, a characteristic that contributed to its widespread recognition. It introduced its first color photos in the 1910s and, during the Cold War, committed itself to presenting a balanced view of the physical and human geography of countries beyond the Iron Curtain. Over time, the magazine evolved to become an advocate on environmental issues. Until 2015, the National Geographic Magazine was wholly owned and managed by the National Geographic Society. Since 2019, The Walt Disney Company has held controlling interest. The magazine covers a range of topics, including geography, history, nature, science, and world culture. Known for its distinctive appearance—a thick square-bound glossy format with a yellow rectangular border—it includes map supplements from National Geographic Maps with subscriptions and is available in both traditional print and interactive online editions. By 1995, the magazine circulated worldwide in almost forty local-language editions, with a global monthly circulation of at least 6.5 million (down from about 12 million in the late 1980s), including 3.5 million within the U.S. As of 2015, it had earned 25 National Magazine Awards. As of October 2022, National Geographic's Instagram page boasts 243 million followers, the most for any account not belonging to an individual celebrity. Its circulation as of December 31, 2022, was approximately 1.8 million. In 2023, National Geographic underwent significant changes, including laying off all staff writers and planning to cease US newsstand sales in the following year.",
